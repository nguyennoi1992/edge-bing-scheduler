## 🧠 How It Works

1. At the scheduled time (or when clicking **Run Now**):

    * Opens `https://rewards.bing.com`
    * Automatically clicks all available, uncompleted Rewards cards
2. After Rewards tasks finish:

    * Starts Bing searches
    * Each search opens with a **random delay** between tabs
3. Stops automatically after completing all configured searches
